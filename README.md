## Getting Started

Welcome to the VS Code Java world. Here is a guideline to help you get started to write Java code in Visual Studio Code.

## Folder Structure

The workspace contains two folders by default, where:

## User Interface

- System Manager
- Sales Department
- Manufacture Department
- Stock Control Deparment
- Recycle Department


- `src`: the folder to maintain sources included (base, controller, fxml)
    - `base` : Main function used (arrayFile + Defined Methods)
    - `controller` : Contains all the controller to handle each of used scene page in fxml (listed in fxml Sub-Folder)
    - `fxml` : Contains all the design code for all the scene page

- `lib`: the folder to maintain dependencies

Meanwhile, the compiled output files will be generated in the `bin` folder by default.

> If you want to customize the folder structure, open `.vscode/settings.json` and update the related settings there.

## Dependency Management

The `JAVA PROJECTS` view allows you to manage your dependencies. More details can be found [here](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode-java-dependency#manage-dependencies).
