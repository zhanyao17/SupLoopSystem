## Getting Started

Welcome to the VS Code Java world. Here is a guideline to help you get started to write Java code in Visual Studio Code.

## Folder Structure

The workspace contains two folders by default, where:

- `src`: the folder to maintain sources included (base, controller, fxml)
    - `base` : Main function used (arrayFile + Defined Methods)
    - `controller` : Contains all the controller to handle each of used scene page in fxml (listed in fxml Sub-Folder)
    - `fxml` : Contains all the design code for all the scene page

- `logo`: the folder to store jpeg/png file for table picture (fxml)

Meanwhile, the compiled output files will be generated in the `bin` folder by default : Contains all class files.

> If you want to customize the folder structure, open `.vscode/settings.json` and update the related settings there.
